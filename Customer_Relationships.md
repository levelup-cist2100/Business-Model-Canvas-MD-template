# Customer Relationships

As a key to any good relationship, communication is an essential way to build customer relationships. Level Up will provide a long-term and direct personal assistance relationship with customers. Positive customer relations will result in an array of benefits for our company including more potential leads and higher customer retention rates. Our company focused on customer retention, loyalty, and satisfaction.

Our Marketing department will send every customer in its scattered data repository a holiday greetings.
 
Also, we are going to provide a loyalty program, customers earn points for buying your services. After earning a certain number of points, the customer gets a reward. For example, you could reward a customer with a discount on their next purchase of our courses.
 
Level Up will invite customer feedback to show we are listening by conducting a survey on our website. Whether customers have a good or bad opinion about your business, they will make their feelings known. Promoting our business and listening to our customers are equally important.
 
Our company is going to initiate a multiyear program to automate and integrate all its customer data so that it could engage in effective customer relationship management using Oracle’s Marketing, Sales, Data, and Service Cloud. Oracle Marketing cloud provides a cloud-based platform to connect firms’ marketing data, centrally orchestrate cross-channel customer interaction, engage the right audience, and analyze performance. This tool helps us with managing marketing automation campaigns, providing cross-channel customer experiences, creating, and managing engaging content, “listening” to customer conversation about a service, and engaging with social messaging.
