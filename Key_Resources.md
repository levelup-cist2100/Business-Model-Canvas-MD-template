# Key Resources

LevelUp’s resources can be thought of in four separate categories, physical assets, intellectual properties, human capital, and Financial Resources. Within each of these categories is a mix of both leased and owned assets. This mixture will evolve over the first five years of business. The following is the list of assets LevelUp will acquire to establish our initial business model:

### Physical Assets

LevelUp’s physical assets will include all necessary hardware to host the LevelUp web platform as well as a physical location to house these items. This equipment is both for hosting purposes and for data storage, for proprietary content as well as client information. Hardware will be purchased for the initial launch of the platform but all physical spaces shall be leased.

### Intellectual Properties

The vast majority of LevelUp’s assets consist of intellectual properties. This includes our in-house designed web platform for providing service to our customers and all of LevelUp’s self-generated coursework and learning materials. In addition to the materials that will be provided to our students, our intellectual property will include all branded materials, from the web domain bearing our name to our registered trademarks in North America.

LevelUp will make use of subscription services from G Suite as an office productivite suite. And, although LevelUp's intellectual property will be stored and hosted locally, materials will be backed up remotely on cloud space leased from Amazon Web Services (AWS).
		
### Human Capital

LevelUp will require human capital across a wide range of fields and expertises. The human capital falls into 4 categories, each requiring a different set of skills, though personnel can overlap into multiple categories depending on their individual skill sets. The 4 categories are: education specialists, technical support, financial staff, and the management team.
		
Education specialists will fill the role of content development, tutoring, and student advising. Those with a role in this category must also be fluent in all areas of our coursework, this makes them prime for overlapping into the technical support staff area of our business during LevelUp’s establishment as an online educator.
		
Technical support staff includes those that will set up and maintain LevelUp’s physical assets on-site as well as maintaining the web platform and assisting with student account issues. These personnel must be experts in system management, web development and have the people skills necessary to assist students.
		
Financial staff includes personnel who will maintain LevelUp’s books as new capital is sought after for our initial release and once fees are being collected from the student body for services provided.

The management team consists of the 5 members of the founding staff of LevelUp. Each providing their own skill set to the business. These 5 members will initially fulfill all requirements in other categories until LevelUp workload out paces initial staffing, requiring additional staff to be hired on.
		
### Financial Resources

Funding for LevelUp’s initial launch will be provided by private investment, the majority of which will be provided by the 5 founding members. These funds will be maintained in accounts listing LevelUp’s Tax Identification Number and will be used for the sole purpose of business. In addition to LevelUp’s financial accounts, a 3rd party transaction platform will be used in order to process all student transactions.
