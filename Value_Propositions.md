With LevelUp, you can learn more at your own time. With every class, and every lesson, learn more than you could have in a classroom. At LevelUp we believe online learning can be more than just a glorified chat room. With our product we transform lectures into experiences, and experience into knowledge. The LevelUP will operate on a website where video lectures, tutorials, and online classes will be posted to paying customers. These educational resources will be focused on IT related topics, including but not limited to programming languages, computer networking, artificial intelligence, and computer security. LevelUp will introduce the most popular languages such as Java and C++ (Tambad,2020). Web Languages, including Javascript, HTML, CSS along with Python, are increasing the most in popularity (Kamaruzzaman,2020). Given that the focus of the service is limited to IT related topics, going forward into the next 5 years the main objective is to increase both the quality and quantity of educational resources available to the customer. This will allow a wide range of topics to be covered, all expertly prepared for an eager student to begin learning.

In conclusion, LevelUP introduces more popular IT online classes for an affordable price, with multiple platforms, and help students develop knowledge in IT area as a result become successful software engineers in different fields of business.
