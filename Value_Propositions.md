# Value Propositions

With LevelUp, you can learn more during your own time. With every class, and every lesson, you can learn more than you could have in a classroom. At LevelUp we believe online learning can be more than just a glorified chat room. With our products we transform lectures into experience, and experience into knowledge. 

LevelUp will operate on a website where video lectures, tutorials, and online classes will be posted to paying customers. These educational resources will be focused on IT related topics divided into two types, programming language learning lessons, and general Information Technology lessons. Content will be delivered in an environment that is conducive to quick learning and knowledge retention, accessible from computer, cell phone and tablet. LevelUp will create a customer response system for the purpose of improving the quality of lessons. Distance education, with its flexible scheduling and broader accessibility, is desirable for everyone who must work full- or part-time while balancing personal obligations.

LevelUp will be initially released with lessons in six areas. Three areas will introduce some of the most popular languages: Java, C++ (Tambad, 2020), and Python. While three areas will cover some of the most popular IT topics outside of language learning: Introduction to Machine Learning, Introduction to Digital Marketing, and Tech Support Fundamentals (Coursera, 2020). Web Languages, including Javascript, HTML, and CSS, are increasing the most in popularity (Kamaruzzaman, 2020) and will be looked at for future course material. Given that the focus of the service is limited to IT related topics, going forward into the next 5 years the main objective is to increase both the quality and quantity of educational resources available to the customer. This will allow a wide range of topics to be covered, all expertly prepared for an eager student to begin learning.

Looking at our target consumer, we want to offer multiple affordable educational packages. The average person in this target demographic works a full-time job and doesn’t have time to attend in person classes. Many people in general are starting to take more online courses to gain knowledge or get degrees. LevelUp wants to arm people with the knowledge they need to be able to be successful in the IT field. LevelUp will provide access to materials in two distinct pay schemes. All content for a particular class can be paid for in one small sum and access to that course will be available for 1 year, including all updates to the material as changes occur. Or access to LevelUp's content can be obtained on a monthly subscription base, where all materials for all topics are available to the learner.

At LevelUp we value time and our consumers. Time is money and that means that time is very valuable. We want to make the time and money spent on our products to be worth it. We strive to make all customers happy, whether it is someone wanting to learn things for personal interest or someone trying to progress in a career. LevelUp wants people interested in IT to save money, learn more and be more successful in the IT field.
