# Key Partners

LevelUp is an education platform that is being designed and created from the ground up. Because of this, no strategic partners or joint venture opportunities have been identified. However, because of this ground up design plan, a great deal of time and expense must be focused on platform development and content generation. This puts LevelUp in a position to benefit greatly from use of independent contractors in a buyer-supplier context during the initial development phase.

### Platform Design

During the initial phase of platform design it will be necessary to hire independent contractors to assist. These contractors will be key buyer-supplier partners during this first phase.

### Content Research

Though the founders of LevelUp have researched and identified which topics LevelUp will generate course content for initially, it will be imperative to gain key partners during the initial content research phase of this business venture. These contractors will be key buyer-supplier partners during this phase in assisting with the identification of necessary learning points which will be in each of our selected topics.

### Content Generation

The generation of content; slide shows, videos, digital laboratories and more, will be a large bulk of the required work to get LevelUp off the ground and act as a successful service provider in the online education field. Much of the first phase content generation must fall to contract workers, acting as key partners, in order to complete such a large milestone in a timely and cost effective manner.
