# Customer Segments

LevelUp is initially targeting two distinct customer segments. Each of these segments consist of North American residents who have a household income between $35,000 and $49,999 annually. The distinction between the two segments comes with learning objectives. Students fall into one of two categories: programming language learner, or general Information Technology skill learner. LevelUp is aimed at providing a wide range of Information Technology classes and a distinction in learning environments must be set between these two customer segments.

Household income is used as an identifier because North American residents who have a household income between $35,000 and $49,999 annually comprises 12.0% of households (Table A-2, 2019). If pricing models are developed for this segment, the barrier to entry will be low enough that the next highest income range, $50,000 to $74,999, will not be excluded. This is important as $50,000 to $74,999 comprises 17.2% of households in the United States (Table A-2, 2019). This allows for a pricing model that is appropriate for 29.2% of households while still maintaining both perceived and real value by not underpricing the product.

The expected age of our target customer will be those between the ages of 18 and 40. This is because these are the ages that are most likely for a individual to either transition into an IT related field, or join an IT related field. Any age group past is highly unlikely to consider transitioning from their career paths, and therefore unlikely to pursue any IT educational resources.

Given that our target customer will have $35,000 to $75,000 a year, the customer will likely not have the spare money or time to pay for a more standard education experience, such as a college education; this is especially problematic considering that college tuition rates can reach as high as $50,000 for a year of classes. Our product will provide our target customer segment a much cheaper alternative to a more formal education experience while still offering a high quality education.
