# Customer Segments

LevelUp is initially targeting two distinct customer segments. Each of these segments consist of North American residents who have a household income between $35,000 and $49,999 annually. The distinction between the two segments comes with learning objectives. Students fall into one of two categories: programming language learner, or general Information Technology skill learner. LevelUp is aimed at providing a wide range of Information Technology classes and a distinction in learning environments must be set between these two customer segments.

Household income is used as an identifier because North American residents who have a household income between $35,000 and $49,999 annually comprises 12.0% of households (Table A-2, 2019). If pricing models are developed for this segment, the barrier to entry will be low enough that the next highest income range, $50,000 to $74,999, will not be excluded. This is important as $50,000 to $74,999 comprises 17.2% of households in the United States (Table A-2, 2019). This allows for a pricing model that is appropriate for 29.2% of households while still maintaining both perceived and real value by not underpricing the product.
