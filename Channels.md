# Channels

First detail the channels through which you would contact your customer segments.
A reminder, our targeted customer segment is North Americans with a household income of 35-50k. This means our audience will most likely have the internet and use social media. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube will be of use to us. Our target customers also include individuals who want to learn programming skills and IT skills. I believe many of these people enjoy video games making Twitch another viable option.

Using social media described above to send targeted advertisements to our customer segments will be the primary method of raising awareness. Another method we could employ is sponsoring Twitch Streamers and Youtubers to promote our product. Other services like Brilliant, Audible, Skillshare, and more have used sponsored ads on YouTube successfully and I believe our services would succeed here as well.
 
We will have a mobile friendly website that clearly lays out who we are (LevelUP), what our mission is, and what we ultimately provide. It will also facilitate searching for classes/courses, enrollment, and purchase of service.
We will have another website for currently enrolled students. This will provide the tools and services we provide that are not directly course related (like tutoring, clubs, forums, student email, advising, and more).
We could use and monitor club and forum activities using Discord. While ZOOM does have its uses I believe Discord will bring a level of community to LevelUP it will desperately need (Being totally online). Discord as a company has also expressed that they will be moving away from targeting video gaming communities and be more palatable to a larger variety of people.
 
Our customers will be able to use various forms of credit for payment. They can use credit or debit cards. We will accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express, as well as PayPal. Customers will be able to select the course or membership plan they want and pay for it. Once payment has been verified, they will have the content they selected unlocked. 

Value will be in the form of content and customer service. LevelUp wants to provide customers with a lot of content for a lower cost than a college or university would offer. We will provide ways for customers to give us feedback and suggestions for improvement. We will answer all questions in a timely manner and offer course assistance and tutorials. The customer will always feel like they can ask questions and get appropriate answers quickly. 

LevelUp will support customers by always being available to answer questions and to help resolve problems. Our website will be up to date and be easy to navigate. If the website needs to go down for maintenance, customers will be notified several days in advance. When helping a customer we can try to gauge their mood. We will move forward with the intent of making sure no one walks away below a certain standard of satisfaction. We will always try to improve on our customer-business relationship. The customerâ€™s needs always come first.
