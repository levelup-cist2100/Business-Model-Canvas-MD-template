# Key Activities

LevelUp's Key Activities can be divided into four categories: Research, Production, Marketing, and Sales and Support. Some activities have a far reach, and as such, fall into multiple categories.

### Research

Research must first start by identifying courses that will bring value to the student, attract our target segments, and be viable for online learning. LevelUp has initially identified six courses which meet these wickets. In order to generate superior content, that is a value for our students, a great deal of expense will have to be awarded to researching all required information that will be necessary to create best in class content. Once content has been generated, it will have to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it is still accurate and up-to-date. Content and coursework will be reviewed on an annual basis.

In addition to researching the correct courses, it is essential that LevelUp identifies methods which are best suited for our students' online learning experience. Video lessons, digital code labs, written documentation, and slideshows are all viable candidates, or any combination thereof.

Research must also be conducted to ensure that marketing is both targeted and effective. This is discussed further in the marketing category.

### Production

Once appropriate courses have been identified during research activities, a method for course generation and presentation must be chosen. Once the method of production is chosen coursework creation can begin. After a section of a course is completed, quality control must be performed to ensure that the materials are useful, functional, appropriate, and presented in an appropriate manner.

LevelUp will create its web platform from the ground up. Using information generated from content research, an appropriate platform will be developed that is capable of displaying materials in a manner conducive to learning. This web platform must be continually reassessed to ensure user security and that a quality product is being delivered to our students.

### Marketing

Market research will be necessary to target our identified customer segment. Research will be needed to identify the most effective and cost beneficial means of reaching this segment.

### Sales and Support

Clerical tasks must be undertaken to support LevelUpâ€™s day-to-day operations. These include tasks to maintain payroll, interfacing with 3rd party service providers, and bookkeeping.

Support must be provided to the LevelUp web platform. Students will have access to live, online lesson support during work hours and personnel must be scheduled for this task. Additionally, support must be provided for any issues that users may have on the web platform. Time must be allotted for customer support in this capacity.
